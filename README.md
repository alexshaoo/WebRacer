3. Install the required dependencies: `sudo apt-get install build-essential libsfml-dev libboost-all-dev`
4. Build the project: `make`
5. Run the project: `./non_euclidean`

## Plan Moving Forward
As of now, we are planning to add more features to enhance the gameplay experience such as multiplayer mode, new objects, better graphics, etc. We are also looking forward to extending the engine to support VR headsets and providing more examples for users to learn from.
